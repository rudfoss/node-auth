##`makeSessionConfigObject`
This function helps you to generate a secure configuration for your `express-session` by enforcing required configurations and setting defaults to secure and optimized values. The returned object can be passed directly to the express-session initializer function or you may modify it by adding or overwriting settings as needed.
