# Development
TODO
* Fetch and cache identity metadata in the background
* Structure of stored access tokens etc
* Test the code and helpers
* Error handling best practice
* Test passed in functions like `onBeforeLogin` etc
* Using the passport strategy directly - should we have this as a use case, or just reference to using the Azure package directly?
